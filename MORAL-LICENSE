As specified by the LICENSE file, dbbench is free software published under
version 2 of the Apache license. That covers the copying part of the license.
When using dbbench, you are encouraged to uphold the following moral
obligations:

- If you publish results that are done using dbbench, it should be clearly
  stated that dbbench was used. The specific version should also be listed.

- If you develop features or bug fixes for dbbench, they should be sent
  upstream for inclusion into the main repository. This isn't specific to
  dbbench, that is a general rule for any open source project. It's just the
  Right Thing to do. Plus it means that you don't have to maintain the feature
  or change internally. In the long run, this is saving you a lot of time.

I would consider the above to fall under "common courtesy", but since
people tend to have differing opinions of that, it doesn't hurt to spell out
my expectations clearly.
